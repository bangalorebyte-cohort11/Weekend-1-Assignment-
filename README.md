Inheritance Practice

This is taken from Chapter 13 in Core python. 

1) Create Stock Portfolio Class. For each company, your database tracks the name, ticker symbol, purchase date, purchase price, and number of shares. Methods include: add new symbol (new purchase), remove symbol (all shares sold), and YTD or Annual Return performance for any or all symbols given a current price (and date). See also Exercise 7-6.

2) Read through the OOPs.doc. It is really a great chapter on OOPs and inheritance.
